    <h2 class="grey">Who was Pythagoras?</h2>
    <h3 class="grey"><strong>The Article is Linked at the Bottom of the Page</strong></h3>
    <p class="grey">In “Pythagoras (570-495 BCE)”, an article by Daniel Tore, Tore asserts the belief that  Pythagoras was an undervalued philosopher that was very secretive. Tore adds credibility to his statement by talking about Pythagoras having a cult even in early life. To add on, he also talks about him being very secretive so we have limited knowledge about Pythagoras. Tore supports this idea by stating that we don’t know much about why the Pythagorean Theorem is called the Pythagorean Theorem. He says it could be named that because he proved, but it originated in Babylon, then went to Egypt, and then ancient Greece. Finally, the author talks about the Pythagorean Brotherhood. To summarize, the Pythagorean Brotherhood is an Atheistic cult that is held upon the idea that everything can be explained through mathematical and philosophical beliefs. Tore wanted to inform the reader about what we know about Pythagoras.</p>

    <h2 class="grey">What was Pythagoreanism</h2>
    <h3 class="grey"><strong>The Article is Linked at the Bottom of the Page</strong></h3>
    <p class="grey">In the article “Pythagoreanism”, by Holger Thesleff, he reports what Pythagoreanism is like. One of the first parts of Pythagoreanism is that everything in nature is math and music.  Another way he puts his idea on his shoulders is by concluding that they use philosophical understanding to purify someone. Lastly, he tells the reader that one of the other ways it is defined is by understanding the Pythagorean theorem. Thesleff wrote this articular masterpiece to help the reader understand Pythagoreanism.</p>

    <h2 class="grey">The Pythagorean Theroem</h2>
    <h3 class="grey"><strong>The Article is Linked at the Bottom of the Page</strong></h3>
    <p class="grey">In “A Brief History of the Pythagorean Theorem”, an article about the Pythagorean Theorem by The Geometry Center of Minnesota, states that the pythagorean theorem is one of the most important equations in history. The author supports this idea by giving the reader a hands-on activity to demonstrate this equation for people to learn, understand, and apply the knowledge. The author talks about another idea for the reader. This is where it demonstrates an excursion with a square root spiral. The author gives a third statement about who created the Pythagorean Theorem.  It talks about Plimpton 322. It is a 4000 year old Babylonian text. The author wrote this article to inform people about the Pythagorean Theorem.</p>
