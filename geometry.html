    <h1>Geometry</h1>
    <article id="summary">
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>Geometry is the branch of mathematics concerned with the study of shapes, sizes, distances, and the properties of space. It provides the language and framework for describing the physical world, from the simplest lines and angles to the most complex multidimensional structures. At its core, geometry is the study of how objects relate to one another through position, form, and measurement.</p>

    <article id="origins">
      <h2>Origins and Historical Context</h2>
      <p>Geometry originated from practical needs: land measurement, architecture, astronomy, and navigation. Ancient civilizations such as Egypt and Babylon used geometric rules long before they were formalized.
         The first systematic treatment of geometry is attributed to the Greeks, especially Euclid, whose Elements organized geometric knowledge into axioms, definitions, and logical proofs. This structure became the foundation of mathematics for over two thousand years.
         Later developments expanded geometry beyond Euclid’s framework, leading to non‑Euclidean geometries, analytic geometry, and modern geometric theories used in physics and computer science.

      <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
      <h3>Points</h3>
      <p>
        A point represents a location in space. It has no size, dimension, or shape. It is the most fundamental object in geometry.
      </p>
      <h3>Lines</h3>
      <p>
        A line is an infinite one‑dimensional object extending in both directions. It is defined by any two distinct points.
      </p>
      <h3>Planes</h3>
      <p>
       A plane is a flat, two‑dimensional surface extending infinitely in all directions. Three non‑collinear points determine a unique plane.
      </p>
      <h3>Angles</h3>
      <p>
        An angle is formed by two rays sharing a common endpoint. Angles measure rotation and are fundamental in describing shapes and motion.
      </p>
      <h3>Shapes and Figure</h3>
      <p>
        Geometric figures include polygons, circles, solids, and more abstract objects. Their properties are studied through measurement, symmetry, and transformation.

      <h2>Branches of Geometry</h2>
      <h3>Euclidean Geometry</h3>
      <p>The classical geometry of flat space. It studies points, lines, triangles, circles, and polygons using Euclid’s axioms.</p>
      <h3>Analytic Geometry</h3>
      <p>Introduced by René Descartes, analytic geometry uses coordinates and algebra to describe geometric objects. It forms the basis of calculus and modern physics.</p>
      <h3>Non-Euclidean Geometry</h3>
      <p>Developed in the 19th century, these geometries arise when Euclid’s parallel postulate is replaced. They include:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hyperbolic geometry</strong> (many parallels)</li>
        <li><strong>Elliptic geometry</strong> (no parallels)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These geometries are essential in general relativity and cosmology.</p>
      <h3>Differential Geometry</h3>
      <p>Uses calculus to study curves, surfaces, and higher‑dimensional manifolds. It is the mathematical language of modern physics.</p>
      <h3>Topology</h3>
      <p>A highly abstract branch studying properties preserved under continuous deformation. It generalizes geometry beyond rigid shapes.</p>

      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <p>Geometry is foundational across science, engineering, and technology:</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physics</strong>: spacetime, motion, fields, relativity</li>
        <li><strong>Computer graphics</strong>: rendering, modeling, animation</li>
        <li><strong>Architecture</strong>: structural design, spatial planning</li>
        <li><strong>Robotics</strong>: motion planning, kinematics</li>
        <li><strong>Astronomy</strong>: orbits, distances, celestial mechanics</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science</strong>: high‑dimensional geometry, clustering</li>
        <p>Geometry is not just a school subject — it is a universal language for describing reality.</p>
      </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Geometry provides the structural backbone of mathematics and the physical sciences. From ancient land surveying to modern theories of the universe, geometry continues to evolve, offering deeper insight into the nature of space, form, and structure. As mathematics advances, geometry remains one of its most essential and enduring pillars.</p>
